## Commonly Asked Questions ü§î
What will happen to my old build?
> Don't worry, you can find your old bases in `backup/(year-month-day-hour-minute)` format. You could push these builds back if you'd like by moving the current build to a new backup manually and dragging the old build back

Can I use this without credit?
> Sure, just please __do not__ claim this is your base. That's all I ask from you. Follow MIT guidelines.

What handlers are there already?
> I provide a **Button, Command, Event, Modal, and Select Menu** base by default. There's more iterations in some of the modals, so review the code if you need to do so.

Are there any example commands?
> Yes, I provide a **/help**, **/ping**, and **/presence** command as examples. Review those to learn about the handlers!
